# BST 6200 Spatial Statistics and Disease Mapping

**Spring 2020**

**Instructor**: Professor [Steve E. Rigdon](https://www.slu.edu/public-health-social-justice/faculty/rigdon-steven.php)

**Introduction**: This course covers models for spatial data, that is, data that are geographically coded. Specific attention is given to disease rates which may vary across regions

**Purpose**: Students should learn to apply the appropriate statistical method to data sets that include geographic information.

**Description**: Statistical methods for disease data that include geographic information. Methods include spatial scan statistics, kriging, measures of autocorrelation, Moran's I, regression with exposure data and covariates. Disease maps and relative risk estimation. Mapping and geographic information systems. Bayesian methods of estimation for conditional autoregressive models.
